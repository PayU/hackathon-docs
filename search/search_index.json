This is a hybrid model that combines retrieval and generation techniques to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks.</p> <p>The traditional approach to language models involves training them to generate text from scratch based on the input they receive. However, sometimes it's more effective to combine generation with retrieval of existing information. This is where RAG models come in.</p> <p>RAG models consist of two main components:</p> <p>Retrieval Component: This part of the model retrieves relevant information or passages from a large dataset of text. It's like having a search engine that retrieves relevant snippets of text based on a query.  </p> <p>Generation Component: Once the relevant information is retrieved, the generation component takes over. It generates the final output, incorporating the retrieved information to create coherent and contextually relevant responses.</p> <p>RAG models are particularly useful for tasks that require a combination of knowledge retrieval and creative generation, such as question answering, content summarization, and more. They leverage the strengths of both techniques to produce high-quality outputs.</p> <p></p> <p>Let's go over what we see here and start with phase 2</p>"},{"location":"RAG/#uploading-files-2","title":"Uploading files (2)","text":"<p>Jarvis supports uploading files and taking care of everything that happens.

Proper connector setup and config can mitigate many issues.\",}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"simple/","title":"Zero shot prompt","text":""},{"location":"simple/#zero-shot-prompt","title":"Zero shot prompt","text":"<p>Zero-Shot Prompting: If you\u2019ve interacted with an LLM-powered chatbot before, you\u2019ve likely already used zero-shot prompting unwittingly.
