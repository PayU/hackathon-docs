Welcome to Jarvis documentation.  
Jarvis is an abstraction layer, built for GPO 2023 Gen AI Hackathon.

Jarvis mission is to create an easy-to-use API that expose different foundation models offered by AWS Bedrock,
To be consumed easily and efficiently to enable the hackathon teams focus on their solution rather than implementing
common patterns in the Gen AI world.

Jarvis supports 3 types of functionalities:

1. Zero shot prompts that are passed to the foundation model by your choice.
2. Ability to send prompts on private GPO data that is uploaded prior to the prompt (RAG Pattern).
3. Ability to have a chat conversation with the foundation model where Jarvis will persist the chat history for you.


In addition to that, Jarvis supports the upload of private GPO data that will be stored safely on the GPO AWS account
and will be enabled to receive queries (RAG + Chat)

More information about these APIs and how to upload private data can be found in this documentation site.
